"""
3D Volume
Write a program that calculates the volume o of the three-dimensional shapes mentioned to the right. It should take as input the parameter(s) necessary to calculate the volume (A, r , h ). You should take in each variable you need in turn. Ie. for the cube, take in the length, for the sphere, take in the radius, etcâ€¦

The output should be USER FRIENDLY.
